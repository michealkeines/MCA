## Mutually Exclusive Events (Disjoing events or Disjoint classes)

Imagine that you’re driving down the road, and you’ve arrived at an intersection. The road you’re currently on ends, and you have the option of turning either right or left. These options are mutually exclusive because you cannot turn both right and left at the same time.

## Exhaustive Events

When two events are mutually exclusive, it means they cannot both occur at the same time. But it doesn’t necessarily imply that one of the two events has to happen.

When two events are exhaustive, it means that one of them must occur.

Think again of a coin toss. The results are mutually exclusive (it will be either heads or tails; it can’t be both on the same flip). And it will be one of the two options — heads and tails are the only possible options (thus they are exhaustive).

## Independent Events

Mutually exclusive events are two events that cannot occur at the same time. The occurrence of one event has a direct impact on the probability of the other. Independent events are the exact opposite — Independent events are those that do not affect the likelihood of each other.

The results of multiple coin flips are independent of one another. We know that when we flip a coin, the chances of flipping either heads or tails are mutually exclusive. We can’t flip both heads and tails at the same time. But what about if you flip a coin three times in a row? The results of the first coin flip and are completely independent of the results of the second and third coin flips. Flipping heads on one of the flips doesn’t make you any more or less likely to flip heads the next time.
