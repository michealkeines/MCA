Classification

Target will be discreate or categorical value

Eg: Is this a cat? True / False

Regression

Target will be Numerical 

Eg: Loan score for a profile

Actual Working

![[Pasted image 20220709073555.png]]

every value from the training data set is mapped in graph

we check all the 1st level neighors of our sample, and we take vote based on the number

Eg: check if its while or black

if our sample has 5 neighbors and all of them are white, the we label our samplle as white

if our sample has 3 neighours as while and 2 as black, we take the highest, which is white

it uses lazy learning or instance bases learning
