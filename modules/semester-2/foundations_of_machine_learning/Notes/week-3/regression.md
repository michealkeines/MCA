Model/ Hypothesis representation

In general the regression function is actually the model that is generated by the model

and regression coefficients are called the model parameters

model can also be called as hypothesis

how do we know if a function is the best fit

![[Pasted image 20220717171243.png]]

difference between the y and y' should be less for most values, that will be considered as best fit

y -> value as per our model function
y' -> actual location of the point

How does linear regression works?
