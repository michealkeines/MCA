Model and generalization

Machine learning algorithms generate model

Model is a mathematical structure thatt learns and generalize the data

we decide based on probability

![[Pasted image 20220629095355.png]]

so we have try to reduce generalization error

Examples

If the performance increases with experience, we could conclude that the models is learning the Task

Good example

Inductive vs Deductive Learning

![[Pasted image 20220629101032.png]]

we find patters in the data we present 

that we have input and output

we try to find a patternn that work for all inputs

Types of Tasks

Regression

![[Pasted image 20220629101304.png]]

Regression is a method for understanding the relationship between independent variables or features and a dependent variable or outcome. Outcomes can then be predicted once the relationship between independent and dependent variables has been estimated. 

Machine learning regression generally involves plotting a line of best fit through the data points. The distance between each point and the line is minimised to achieve the best fit line.

The model can then be leveraged to predict the outcome of new and unseen input data, or to fill a gap in missing data. 

Classification

![[Pasted image 20220629101327.png]]

A classification problem is when the output variable is a category, such as “red” or “blue” or “disease” and “no disease”. A classification model attempts to draw some conclusion from observed values. Given one or more inputs a classification model will try to predict the value of one or more outcomes.

Clustering

![[Pasted image 20220629101406.png]]

Clustering is the task of dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group and dissimilar to the data points in other groups. It is basically a collection of objects on the basis of similarity and dissimilarity between them. 

## Experience in ML means Data

Information vs Knowledge

![[Pasted image 20220629102243.png]]

Information is a fact

Knowledge is a outcome of processing facts

# Performance

 What Is the Difference Between Accuracy and Precision?

Accuracy is close to a known value; precision measures repeatability
