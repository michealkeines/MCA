redrecting output creates a regular file

touch can be used to create a file

mkdir is to create create directory

mkfifi to create names pipes

ln to create hard or soft symlink


move command changes the absolute path of the file, its faster than copy

mv source destination

cp source destination

cp -r source destination, recursily copyu everythign inside a dir

if we move a directory, absolute path of everthing wuithin the directory also changes

rm can be used to delete a file
if we delete a file, it cant be recycled 

we can use rm -i to prompt for confimation

to delete a directory we cant just remove the dir as it has file inside that will be left invalid, if we do that so we have to recurisivly delete everthing inside it too

thus we use rm -r directory
