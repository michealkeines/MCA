## Java Bytecode

java bytecode is the output of java compilation

bytecode is executed by java runtime system

all java platforms consist of a java virtual machine(JVM) and an application programming interface (API)

JVM should be installed in the platfrom you use to run java applications

API is collection os software components used to create other applications or components

thus, JVM makes java program portable and secure

## Java Execution Engine

Java execution engine executes the bytecode by reading the bytecode in units, like machine reading code lines one by one

it have three major components:

interpreter - executes the bytecode in sequential method
JIT compiler - enchances the java application performance at run time
Garbage Collector - JVM Heap space will be searched for the possible objects in  use and removes the unusedones.
