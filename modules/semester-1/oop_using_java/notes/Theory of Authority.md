# Statement:
## "Authority Fails without an element of Myth"

The term is herrshaft, it could be translated into authority or domiationn, but domination captures the the acutal meaning

power means likelyhood that people will obey order even agaist resistance

domination means that likelhood that people will actually follow order without being coerced to do so

So the notiion of domination or herrschoft does imply a degree of voluntariness, a minimum level of belief that in fact those who issue orders do have the right ot do so or atleast it is reasonable that they issue orders and i follow the ordders

This has everything to do with the idea of legitimacy

Power + Legitimation adds up to Domination or Authority

Those who are in authority try to legitimate they ideas and come up with reason why people subjected to this authority should obey thier authority

It is a nietzschen idea, that those who are exerrcising power tries to internalize your subjugation to power in a one way or other, they try to create in you a morality, as set of principles by which you would say "Well, this probably may be the right thing for me to do"

this is the weber's idea of legitimacy and it plays a grate role in holding authority


Example:

Power:
	when a professor just reminds the students that if the assigment is not submitted before the end of the day they will be getting zero marks

Authority + with an element of myth
	when a professor starts adding details like, You will benefit from doing this assignment, you will learn more about this society, will be able understand your role in it, the professor tries to internalize what they wanted the students to do, that way the students begin to beleive that it's good for them, it's would be fun or they will learn something out of it, that way the professor was able to convert power into domination by adding an element of myth that the students can hold on to without having to be forced or ordered to do those assignments

The Students internalized their own submission to the authority(Professor)

The degree of submission is relative to the myth they are holding on to, and it will fail if the myth starts to break in the minds of people who are subjected to a certain authority
