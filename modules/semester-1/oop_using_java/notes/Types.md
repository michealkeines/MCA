All computer programs consist of two elements: code and data.

a program can be conceptually organized around its code or around its data.

focusing on "what is happenning" and "who is being affected"

procedure oriented programming:

- it is concentrating on code
- a series of linear steps
- it can be thought of as code acting on data

Object oriented programming:

- organizes a program around its data (that is, objects)
- set of well definded interfaces to the data
- data controlling access to code
