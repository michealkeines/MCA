selection statments

if, switch

they control the flow of the program's execution based upon conditions


switch statment is java mutlti way branch statement

expression must be of type byte, short, int, char, string

if you omit the break, execution will continue into the next statment

the switch can only test for equality, whereas if can evaluate any type of boolean expression.

switch looks only for a match between the value of the expression and one of its case constants

no two case constants in the same switch can have identical values.

A switch statment is usually more efficient than a set of nested ifs

Iteration statements

for, while, do-while

while and for are entry control loop

do-while is exit control loop

while

The while loop is fundamental loop statement

it repeats a statement or block while its controlling expressing is true

the do while loop always executes its body atleast once, as its conditional expression is at the bottom of the loop.


for loop has, initization variable, conidtion, iteration

for each is designed to cycle through as collection of objects, such as array, in strictly sequential fashion, from start to finish

it has a type iter-val and collection

for (type itr-var: collction)

Jump statements

break
continue
return


these statements transfer control to another part of your program


break is used to exit a loop

loop iteration stops at break, and control returns from the loop immediatly to the first statment after the loop

continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop

the return statement is used to explicitly return from as method

it causes program control to transfer back to the called of the method.

it is also catageroized as jump statment
