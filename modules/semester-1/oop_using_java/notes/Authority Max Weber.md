Authority can be also be domination

Domination is better than authority

Macht and Herrschaft

macht - power
herrshaft - authority or domiationn

"herr" means the lord, it captures the asymtrical power relations

webber ideas root from friedrich nietzsche

struggle for power

power means likelyhood that people will obey order even agaist resistance

domination means that likelhood that people will actually follow order without being coerced to do so

So the notiion of domination or herrschoft does imply a degree of voluntariness, a minimum level of belief that in fact those who issue orders do have the right ot do so or atleast it is reasonable that they issue orders and i follow the ordders



mini def:

i cant see any thing other than obeying the orders

This has everything to do with the idea of legitimazy

Power + Legitimation adds up to Domination or Authority

power is really an extreme case, it happens very rarely

that the one who exercises authority, excersices simply by exerting power, coercing people to obey

Those who are in authority try to legitimate they ideas and come up with reason why people subjectted to this authority should obey thier authority

It is a nitizen idea, that thos who are exerrcising power tries to internalize your subjugation to power in a one way or other, hthey try to create in you a morality

as set if principles by which you would say "Well, this probably may be the right thing for me to do"

minimum definition

even if we dont particularly like obeying orders you say "what else can i do?"

under such circumstances
the alternative to if dont obey order would be worse

you may not like the person who issues the authority but the alternattivve is worse

you we pick the leastt worse path

this is the weber's idea of legitimacy

all legitimacy contains an element of a myth

It doesnt mean that the person who tries to justify its authority is telling the truth, whether its true or not is almost besides the point

The most important issue is that it creates a mythology about the reason why you have to obey authority

like here

power is legimitized by fair and fee elections to an office and we belive this person will do a great job having been elected

kazari

alernative is chaos and this guys probalby better than chaos whihc would happen otherwise
