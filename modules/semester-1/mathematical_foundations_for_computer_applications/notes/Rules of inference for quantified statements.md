Universal instantiation
Universal generalisation
Existential instantiation
Existential generatlization

these rules of inference are used extensively in mathematical arguments, often without being explicitly mentioned

All women are wise, that lisa is wise, where lisa is a member of the domain of all women

![[Pasted image 20220111042519.png]]

beacuse we know that for all vairable in a domain x, we can conclude a particule varibale a

# universal generalization

![[Pasted image 20220111040250.png]]

because we know that all the elements in a domain are true we can conculde that a all x in domain are true.

# existential instantiation

![[Pasted image 20220111042323.png]]

because we know that there exist a x in the domian, we can give it a variable name a

# existential generalization

![[Pasted image 20220111042421.png]]

because we know there exist a variable a in the domain, we can say there exist a variable

# Combining Rules of Inferences

we combined universal instantiation, a rule of inference for quantified statements

and modus ponens, a rule of inference for propositional logic.

we will often need to use this combination of rules of inference.

this combination is called universal modus ponens

Everyone who eats granola everyday is health. Linda is not health. therefore linda does not eat granola everyday

p(x) = x eat garnola
q(x) = x is healthy

q(linda) = -q = linda is not health
