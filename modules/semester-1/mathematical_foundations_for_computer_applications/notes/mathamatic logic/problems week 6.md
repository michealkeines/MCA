use a proof by contradiction to prove the sum of an irrattional number and a rational number is irrational

here we prove thhat a rational + rational = rational

by contradiction here we say taht 

a rational (r) + irrational (i) = rational (s)

rearrage this into

a rational (r) + rational (-s) = irrational, this is contradicting our previous statement, tus we can prove the rational + irational will give irrational
