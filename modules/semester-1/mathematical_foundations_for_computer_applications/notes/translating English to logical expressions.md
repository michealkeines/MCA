every student in the class has studied calculus

introduce variable to the statement

for every student x in  the class, x has studied calculus

then introduce the function C(x), which is the statment x has studied calculus

the domain is consiste of all students in the class

there are other correct approaches with different predicates, the approach depends on the subsequent reasoning we want to carry out

for example we may be interested in wider group of people than only those in this class..

for example

if we change the domain to consist of all people, we will need to express our statement as "for every person x, if person x is a student in this class then x has studied calculus"

S(x) reperesents the statement that person x is in this clss

Some students in this class has visited Mexico

it doesnt refer to all the students
so it is a existential quntifier

that can me there is a student in this class with the property that the student has visited mexico

there is a student x in this class having the property that x has visited mexio

M(x), which is the statement x has visited mexico

the domain x consist of the student in this class

![[Pasted image 20220111005421.png]]

for every x in this class, x has the property that x has visited mexico or x has visited canada

we let C(x) be x has visited canda
we let M(x) be x has visisted mexio

the domain x is the every student in this class,

if our statment was there is a person x having the properties that x is a student in this class and x has visited mexico

![[Pasted image 20220111005846.png]]

S(x), x be the person in this class
M(x), x visited mexico
