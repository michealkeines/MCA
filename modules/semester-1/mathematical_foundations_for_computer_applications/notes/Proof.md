Proof

the arguments w have seen so far show that statements involving propositions and quantifies statements are true formal proofs where all steps were supplied and then rules for each step in the argument were given

however, formal proofs of usefull theorems can be extremely long and hard to follow

less important theorems sometimes are called propositions

theorems can be referred to as facts or results
