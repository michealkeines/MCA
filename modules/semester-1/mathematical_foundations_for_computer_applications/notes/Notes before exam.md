Proposition are delarative statement, it has to have TRUTH or FALSE value not both  and not assumptions

Negation of a proposition is the opposite

propoosition: I will cry today
negation: I will not cry today

ALL negation some or none

Tautology

![[Pasted image 20220506235706.png]]

if the result is full of TRUTHS then it is a tautology

Contradition

![[Pasted image 20220507000013.png]]

if the result is full of FALSE then it is  a contradiction

Logical equivalent

![[Pasted image 20220507000113.png]]

if the result of two compound proposition have same truth values as result then they are logical equivalent


but is alos a conjentions like and


Converse:

if p ->q then converse is q -> p

Inverse:

if p then inverrse is -p

Contrapositive:

if p -> q then contrapsitive -q -> -p

for argument questions, we have to find the symbols like(-p or p->q) for all statemnets in that argument and if the truth table works our for final value

![[Pasted image 20220507012401.png]]

if one of the value is false, then the argumrnt is invalid

Rules of inferences:

(p and q) can be simplified into p

Universal instantiation
Universal generalisation
Existential instantiation
Existential generatlization

these rules of inference are used extensively in mathematical arguments, often without being explicitly mentioned

# universal instantiation

All women are wise, that lisa is wise, where lisa is a member of the domain of all women

![[Pasted image 20220111042519.png]]

beacuse we know that for all vairable in a domain x, we can conclude a particule varibale a

# universal generalization

![[Pasted image 20220111040250.png]]

because we know that all the elements in a domain are true we can conculde that a all x in domain are true.

# existential instantiation

![[Pasted image 20220111040517.png]]

![[Pasted image 20220111042323.png]]

because we know that there exist a x in the domian, we can give it a variable name a

# existential generalization

![[Pasted image 20220111040804.png]]

![[Pasted image 20220111042421.png]]

because we know there exist a variable a in the domain, we can say there exist a variable

Translating statement to english

![[Pasted image 20220507043755.png]]

for all x there exist a y such that x is less than y
