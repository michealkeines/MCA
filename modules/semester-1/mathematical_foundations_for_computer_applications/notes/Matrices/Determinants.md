I learned in school like, i use alternative sign for every element in the matrix

but we can calculate it using 

if the row is 2 and column is 1 then

(-1) ^ (2+1) that would give -1 x -1 x -1 = -1

-1 x (derminat of the inside matrix)

if the row is 2 and clolumn is 2 then

(-1) ^ (2+2) that would five -1 x -1 x -1 x -1 = 1

1 x (determnat of the inside matrix)
