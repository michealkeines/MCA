The IOS CLI provides hot keys and shortcuts that make configuring, monitoring, and troubleshooting easier.

Commands and keywords can be shortened to the minimum number of characters that identify a unique selection. For example, the configure command can be shortened to conf because configure is the only command that begins with conf. An even shorter version, con, will not work because more than one command begins with con. Keywords can also be shortened.

The table lists keystrokes to enhance command line editing.
