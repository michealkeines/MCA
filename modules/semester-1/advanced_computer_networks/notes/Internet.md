Internet speed and shared access depends on the network classification

speed of bits transmission through the physical media of the network access can be termed as bandwidth

measure in bits per second bps

Home access methods

DSL - digital subscriber line

Modem = modulator/ demodulator

modulator converts digital data to analog
demodulator converts analog signals to digital form

DSL provider provide different transmission rates at different price

12mbps down & 1.8 mbps up - ITU 1999
24mbps & 2.5 up - ITU 2003

internet access is asymmetric
because the downstream and upstream are differnet

DSL uses the exsisting telephone line(twisted pair)

splitter seperates the data and telephone signals arriving at home and forwards the data signals to the DSL modem

DSLAM - DSL access muliplexer separates the data and phone signals and send the data into internet

same links is used as phone line, upstream data, downstream data


cable internet access uses cable tv infrastructure

shared broadcast communication medium

it divided the hybrid fiber coaxiel HFc network into two channels up and downsteam

downstream - 42.8mbps, up - 30.7 mbps 

clable modem termination system CMTS similar to DSLAM

institutional access network

corporate business connections require higher bandwidth, dedicated connections, managed services

Mobile access cellular network


coverage area of one base station is termed as cell
mobiles in one cell sends messages to the base station in that cell

base station is connected to the edge router for internet access

mobility - smooth transfer of data messages from one base station in a cell to the other known as handoff

cnoverged network

before computer, telephone and broadcase had differnet medium,

converge network deliver data, voice and video in one link
