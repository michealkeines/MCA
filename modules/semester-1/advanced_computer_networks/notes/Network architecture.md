Network Architecture is the design of a computer network

included hardware, software and connectivity

Refers to the technologies that support the infrastructure that moves the data across the network

responsible for standards and frameworks that can address varioud network types and solve problems to improve reliability

Reliable Networks

User expect any designed network to be reliable in operation

reliability = continuity of service

Four characteristic of any reliable network architectures are
- fault tolerance
- scalability
- Quality of Service (QoS)
- Security

Fault tolerence:

Ability to provide continued operation in the presence of faults by introducing redundancy

Scalability

ability to expand the network or services without affecting the existing one

Quality of Service (QoS)

with QoS policy, routers give priority to voice traffic packets compared to data traffic packets

Network Security

- Network infrastructure security, physical security of network devices, preventing unauthorized access to the devices
- Information security, Protection of the information or data transmitted over the network

goals of network security:

confidentiality - only intended users can access the data

Integrity - assurance that the data has not altered with during transmission

Availability - assurance of timely and reliable access to data for authorized users
