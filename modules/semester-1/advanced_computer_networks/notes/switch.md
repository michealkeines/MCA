ethernet switch fundamentals

buffer frames, selectively forward, access segment, transparent device

no collisions, transmit simultaneously

mac address table

layer 2 so it works on mac address

switch learning process

self learning, switch, CAM, content addressable memory

when swithc doesnt know the address of pc in table, it sends an broadcast message and updates the table based on the response

unknown unicast , selected forwarding

when server  frames are there, all are stored in buffers and then it is checked in the table one by one and sent

filtering the frame

interconnecting switch

cut through switching

![[Pasted image 20220120231328.png]]

two variants of cut through switchin

fast forwarding switching

Fragment free switching

Advantages of store and forward switching

Memory buffering on switches

![[Pasted image 20220120231742.png]]

two methods of memory buffering

port based memory

![[Pasted image 20220120231812.png]]

Shared memory

![[Pasted image 20220120231827.png]]


duplex and speed setting

![[Pasted image 20220120231927.png]]

Auto negotiation

![[Pasted image 20220120232033.png]]

duplix mismatch

duplex method and bandwidth speeds are selected based on negotitaion

selection of right media for connection

auto MDIX, switch auto configures the type of cable
