Protocol suite 

group of inter-related protocols necessary to perform a communication function

set of protocals that work together to solve a problem

protocals are viewed in terms of layers

# TCP/IP Protocol

Interaction of protocols in communication between a web server and web client uses TCP/IP protocol suite

TCP/IP protocol suite is used in the internet and an ope n standard maintained by internet engineering taks force (IETF)

standars based protocol suite endrosed by networking industry and approved by standards organizations

Open standards encorage
- interoperability
- competition
- innovation

Standard organizations are 
- vendor neutral
- non-profit organizations
- established to develop and promote the concept of open standards

Internet Standards:

Internet society ISOC - promotes the open development and evolution of internet

Internet Architecture Board IAB - Responsible for management and development of internet standards

Internet Engineering Task Force IETF - Develops, updates, and maintains internet and TCP/IP technologies

Internet Research Task Force IRTF - Focused on long term reserach related to internet and TCP/IP protocols

Standards organizations involved with the development and support of TCP/IP

Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ICANN
coordinates IP address allocation, the management of domain names and assignment of other information

Internet Assigned Number Authority IANA
oversees and manages IP address allocation , domain name management and protocal identifiers for ICAN

Electronic Communication standards

Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE - deicated to creating standards in power and energy, healthcare, telecommunications and networking

Electronic Industries Alliance EIA - develops standards relatinf to eectrical wirign, connectors, and for network equipment racks

Telecommunictaions Industry Association TIA - develops communication standards in radio equipment, voice over IP VoIP devices, cellular towers, satellite communications and more.

International Telecommuncations Union Telecommunication standardization sector ITU-T defines standards for broadband communications such as a digital subscriber line DSL
