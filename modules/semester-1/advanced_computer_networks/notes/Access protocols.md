Muliple access protocols

Two types of links

point to point links

- dialup access
- between ethernet switch and host

eg: routers, switch

broadcast (shared medium)

collision, distrubuted algorithsm, interference

three broad classes

channel partitioning, random access, taking turns

# Channel partitioning

FDMA: frequency division multiple access
characteristics

TDMA: time division multiple access
characteristics

# Random Access
random access examples, collision, detect collisions

# Taking Turns

polling, master node, slave devices, concerns

token passing, node, sequential
