Topology = arrangement of devices in a network

it use symbos to represent devices and links within the network

network diagrams are also called as topology diagrams

Physical topology illustrates the physical locaitonof devices and cables

logical topology illustrates the address scheme for devices and ports

Network edge:
hosts: clients and servers
servers often in data centers

access networks, physical media
wired, wireless links
residential home access
institutional access
mobile access

Network core:
interconnected routers
access via Internet serivce provider (ISP)

End system or hosts
- at the end of the network
- runs application programs (web, email)

client server model
cleint requests through any applicaiton like browser
always on server responds to the request using a reponse

peer-peer model
no dedicated servers, everyone in the network share information
eg: torrents

Guided media:

signals propagate in solid media

twisted pair = two insulated copper wires
- bits encoded as electic signals
- category 3: 10 mbps ethernet
- category 5: 100 mbps ethernet

Fiber optic cable:
- bits are encoded as light signals
- high speed operation through point to point transmission
- low error rate - immune to electro magnetic noise

coaxiel cable - 2 concentric copper conductors & bidirectional
base band - single channel on cable Ex legacy ethernet
broad band - multiple channels on cable Ex: hybrid fiber coax

Unguided Media

signals propagate freely. ex: Radio, electro magnetic spectrum

propagation enviroment effects
reflection, obstruction & interference.

types 

satellite microware (11Ghz tp 14 GHz)
cellular for wide area (20khz to 300 ghz)
wifi lan (unlicensed 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz)

ISP provides internet access to internet to home, company, institution

content provider network is a private network that connects its data center to internet. eg: google.com

ISP gives host address to the customer and content providers

IP internt protocol address to identify a host in the internet
ex: IP address of google.com is 172.217.166.110

ISP

Tier 1 commercial ISP
Tier 2 regional iSP
tier 3 Access ISP
