internet is a network of trillions of computers and other electonic devices connected to share information globally.

internet can be called as network of networks

network = end devices + media + networking devices

end devices = computer, laptops, any deivec that wants to access internet

networking devices = Link layer switches, acesspoint, routers

Media = communication medium connectiong devices

servers are computers that provides informattion to the end devices

client are end device that send requests to the servers to retrieve information

intermediary network devices interconnects end devices eg: routers, switches

Physical link allows a message to travel from source to destination

Messages as Bits progagates between transmitter and receiver pairs

transmitter = encoding bits to signals
receiver = decoding signals to bits
transmission rate = bandwidth (bps)

guided media: signals propagate in solid media eg: copper or fiber cables

unguided media: signals propagate freely through electomagnetic spectrum eg: wifi, cellular, satellite

## Internet components

internet = network edge + access network + core network

network edge = end devices like computers connecting at the end of the network

access network = local netwoek that helps the end devices to get connected to the core network

core network = backbone of the internet

## Network classification

network infrastructures vary greatly in terms of the size of the area

### Personal Area Network (PAN)

connecting devices within a square metres

### Local Area Network(LAN)

network spancs a small geographical area and administered by a single organization or individual

### Wide Area Network (WAN)

network spans over a wide geographical area, typically administered by on or more service providers.


### Wired LAN

Wired LAN is also called as Ethernet, wired network interface cards NIC are used to interface the end device to the media

### Wireless LAN

its alse called as wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi)

wireless NICs are uses


### Internet

internet is a collection of Interconnected LANs and WANs

world wide web(www) connects hunderds of millions of computers world wide such as the internet

the internet is not owned by any individual or group

### intranet

it is a computer network sharing informattion within an organization.

### extranet

an extranet is controlled private network that allows access to partner, vendor and suppliers or an authorized set of customers or trusted thrid parties
