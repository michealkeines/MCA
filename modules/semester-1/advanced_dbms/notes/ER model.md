roleno is underlined, as it is a primary key

type of entity set

## strong entity set

# Relationship

Association between entities

connects different entities through a meaningful relation

descriptive attributes

an attribute associated with a relationship set.

denoted with dashed lines,

Degree of relationship sets

indicates the number of entity types particiapating in a relationship set



degree 1: unary

entiry with a relation set, both participating entities are same

![[Pasted image 20220121002136.png]]

degree 2: binary

two entity  types are participating in relation

binary is every commonly used

![[Pasted image 20220121002234.png]]

degree3 : tenary

three enties types are in a relation

![[Pasted image 20220121002332.png]]

degree n: n-ary

there are n number of relations
