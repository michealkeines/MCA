Design Process:

Initial Phase:
	- Characterize fully the data needs of the prospective databae users
	- output requirements specification of the user
	
Conceptual design phase
	- Chooses a model
	- Applying the concepts of the chosen model for translating these requirements into a conceptual schema of database
	- A fully developed conceptual schema indicates the detailed overview of the enterprise
	
ER model:
	the entities, the attributes of the entities, the relationships among the entities and constraints on the entitites and relationships are specified by the conceptual schema
