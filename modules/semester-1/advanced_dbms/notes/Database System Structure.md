Database System Structure

![[Pasted image 20220108020324.png]]

Database system - partitioned into modules that deal with each of the responsibilities of the overall system

Two major components 
- Storage manager
- Query processor

# Storage Manager

The database is typically required large amount of storage space. so the movement of this data between the disk and the main memory, it takes more time

it is the responsibility of the database system to minimize this movement.

it provides the interface between the low level data which is stored in the database and the application programs and queries submitted to those systems.

it is also responsible for the interaction with the file manager

it translates variious DML statments into low level file system commands

thus storage manager is responsible for storing, retrieving and updating data in the database.

funtionality of storage manager is itself divided into sub components

- Authorization and Integrity Manager
- Transaction Manager
- File Manager
- Buffer Manager

Authorization and integrity manager
- Tests for statisfaction of integrity constraints and checks the authority of users to access data

Transaction manager
- Whenever a transaction is being executed in the database system, there is some properties to be statisfied by each transaction, so the checking of whether the properties by a particular transaction is done by this module as when multiple transactions are executed, it wil be controlled 
- thus it ensures that the database remains in a consistent state despite system failures, and the concurrent transaction executions proceed without conflicting

Buffer manager
- whenever a user request a data, the requested data is firest searched in the buffer, if it not found there, then the request will be given to file manager to fetch the data from the disk and is stored in the buffer, the buffer gets cleared time to time and follows a scheduling algorithm like round robin
- responsible for fetching data from disk storage into main memory and deciding what data to cache in main memory. 
- it enables the database to handle data sizes that are much larger than the size of the main memory

File manager:
- it managers the allocation of space on disk storage and the data structures used to represent information stored on disk


# Query Processor

it helps the databse system to simplify and facilitate access to the data
it allows the database users to obtains good performacne
it translated and updates the quries which are written in non procedural language at the logical level to an efficient sequence of operations at the physical level.

DDL interpreter
- It intreprets DDL statements and records the definitions in the data dictionary.
- the DDL statement which are generated by a DBA. they are interpreted for syntax errors including constraint errors, once clear, it is stored in the database within data dictionary.

DML compiler
- Translates DML statements in a query language into an evaluation plan consisting of low-level instructions that the query evaluation engine understands
- DML compiler also performs query optimization
- the SML statments which are present in the applications are separately compiled with the DML compiler output, after performing a query optimization, in whihc the different ways of solving a query are considered and the most feasible one is selected for every evaluation.

Query evaluation engine
- executes low-level instructions generated by DML compiler
- it interacts with storage management module ot do the subsequent processing of the query


Physical Database

Data files
- data file itself

Data dictionary
- the indices aren't statical data, the DDL interpreter, after interpreting the DDL statement stores the DDL statements stores the definitions in a file called the Data Dictionary
- the data about data.
- stores metadata about the structure of database, in particulare the schema of the database

Indices
- The indicis help in search and faster access of the data from data files.
- every relation has an implicit primary index where the primary key colums with the address location of the corresponding data are stored
- explicit indices can be created by the DBA

Statistical data
- when a query can be returned in different ways, all giving the same results to choose the best alternative. the evalutaion engine makes use of the statistical data
- thus it is used for query optimization and evaluation plan
