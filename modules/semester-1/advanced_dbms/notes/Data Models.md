Threer are different types of databases, such as relational databases, object oriented databases, document databases

how can we distinguish these databases?

it is possible through data models

later models can be used to distinguish different databases in terms of the underlying structure of the database.

the collection of conceptual tools for describing 
- data
- data relationships
- data semantics
- consistency constraints

for describing these we use data modlels

different data models are

- relational model
- ER model
- Object oriented data model
- Object relational data model
- semi structured data model
- heirarchical data model
- network model

# Relational model

it consist of collection of tables to model data and its relationships

Here the data are organized in tables and tables consist of rows and columns

the row represents the relationship among the set of values nad column represents the properties or attributes

# Entity relationship model

it is a high level model used of database design

# Object based data model

# Object relational data model

# Semi structured data model

it allows to represent same type data items tohave different set of attributes

it uses XML extensible markup language

there is separation between the data and its structure

element is the basic form, it has start and end tags
each element will have atrributes and they are placed between the start and end tags

it has a root element it includes all the elements

# Hierarchical Model

It is a primitive model based on tree structure

# Network Model

it is a primitive model based on graph structure
