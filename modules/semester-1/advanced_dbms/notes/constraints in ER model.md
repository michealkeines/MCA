Constraints are the rules to check that data satisfies certain semantics

types of mapping constraints

Mapping cardinalities
Participation constraints

# Mapping cardinality Constraints (cardinality ratio)

Express the number od entities in one entiry set that are associated with entities of another entity set via a relationship set.

Most usefull in describing binary relationship set

A binary relationship set must have one of the following mapping cardinality

# Participation Constraints

Specifies the participation  of entity set in relationship sets

Participation can be total/partial

## Total Participation

## Partial participation

some entities may not participate in any relationship in the relationship set
