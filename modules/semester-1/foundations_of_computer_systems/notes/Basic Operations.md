Input operations

the process of entering data and instructions in to the computer

storing:

data and instructions can be stored for future processing

processing:

operations the are performed on the data and to produce useful information

outputing:

the process of producing results to the outside world

controlling:

the process of controlling the above four operations

each of the component are interconnected using busses, they are all perform together

A typical computer consist of 

CPU (central processing unit)
- ALU (arithmetic logic unit)
- control logic
- registers

Memory
Input/ Output Interfaces

Interconnection between these unit are using 
- Address bus
- Data bus
- Control bus

ALU executes instructions and performs arithmetic and logic operations

data is transfered from primary memory to registers several times before the entire execution is completed

Control unit 
controls the operations performed by the other units
controls the transfer of data and instructions among other units
decode the instructions
communicates with input and output for transfer of data and results

Registers:
temporty storage for fast execution

input - directs data and instruction supplied by the user to the CPU for processing

output - display the results of the processing

storage

primary - volatile, expensive, high speed - ram
secondary - less expensive, larger than primary memory, slower than primary memory
