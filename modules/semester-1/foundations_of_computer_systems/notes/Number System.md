Digital systems including computers run on a 2-valued system called binary system

Transisters are the basic elements in digital systems with on and off states

The binary system has only two digits 0 (represents off) and 1 (represents on)
called as binary digits or bit

computer convert everything to binary format, as they can only understand that format

number system is the method to represent numbers

the base of each number system is called radix which determines how many different symbols are needed to represent a number

why binary not decimal?

Transisters are the fundamental unit in digital computer with only 2 states ON and OFF

In the decimal system: 4 transistor can represent any number up to 15 i.e, we can represent up to 16 values from 0 - 15
