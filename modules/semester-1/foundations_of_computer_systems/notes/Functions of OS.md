Regiser (very small capacity, temporary, extremely fast)

Cache (small capacity, temporary, very fast)

Main memory (medium capacity, temporary, fast)

Secondary Memory (high capacity, permanent, not fast)

tertiary memory (very high capacity, permanent slow)

Data migration

OS focussing on data movement between secondary and main memory

Microprocessor hardware handles data movements between main memory and internal storage

Memory management

to execute a program all of the instruction must be in memory

memory management determines what is in memory and when

optimizing CPU utilization and computer response to users

- keeping track of which parts of memory are currently being used and by whom
- deciding whihc processes and data to move into and out of memory
- allocating and deallocating memory space as needed
